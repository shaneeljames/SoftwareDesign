\section{\textbf{Executive Summary}}
\begin{flushleft}
The problem that we face is that students are in need of extra lessons and tutorials outside of standard lessons provided by the university. We propose a system that can connect students in search of tutors.

The results of the requirements analysis are documented below. This document completely describes the system in terms of the requirements. This document serves as a contextual basis between the client and the developer.

%INTRODUCTION
\section{INTRODUCTION}
\subsubsection{Purpose of the system}
\begin{flushleft}
The purpose of the FindMeTutor application is to provide a convenient means for tutors and students who are looking for tutors to be able to connect within a particular tertiary institute.
\end{flushleft}
\subsubsection{Scope of the system}
\begin{flushleft}
Our team, working on the FindMeTutor application, envisions a successful product to be an Android Application which will be at a students disposal in order to improve their grades and achieve their academic dreams. With limited resources, a stringent budget and capped time, we aim to execute this task in an economical fashion.\\
This goal will be achieved by making use of agile methodology. We will be able to set short term targets to achieve deliverables within sprints, with a long term goal being to present the FindMeTutor Android Application. 
\end{flushleft}
\subsubsection{Objective and success criteria of the project}
\begin{flushleft}
The FindMeTutor Android application will be seen as successful if it facilitates a platform on which tutors and students can meet. We have great hope that the result of this would mean better results obtained by the students, and a manner in which tutors can generate some income and gain some job experience.

%CURRENT SYSTEM
\section{CURRENT SYSTEM}
\subsubsection{Overview}
\begin{flushleft}
Currently, there are many students in search of tutors to help them with particular courses with which they require some support, as well as fellow students or tutors who are available to tutor particular courses of study. However, the problem that is faced on hand is that either pool (students and tutors) are struggling to find each other. 
\end{flushleft}

%PROPOSED SYSTEM
\section{PROPOSED SYSTEM}
\subsection{Overview}
\begin{flushleft}
FindMeTutor app will be a platform through which students and tutors can meet in order to resolve the current situation. 
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
FindMeTutor app will facilitate the following two registration categories: 

\begin{flushleft}
1.Student looking for tutors – they are able to register on the app with merely some personal details (demographic data, email and password).\\
2. Tutor - those who would like to tutor can register on the app by simply filling in some details with respect to the fields of study they are particularly comfortable to tutor.\\
\end{flushleft}
\end{flushleft}
\subsection{Functional requirements - "Shall lists"}

Describes the high-level functionality of the system\\

\begin{comment}
3.2.1 The database has the ability to store data captured of the users of the application (student and tutors data).More specifically, the database will be able to accept numeric data entry and will store the courses under the University of the Witwatersrand's School of Computer science and Applied mathematics undergraduate topics which will be displayed in the drop-down menu when students and tutors will be required to select the courses respectively to which they are enrolled in or able to tutor. \\
3.2.2 The app will provide an effective means through which tutors and students can communicate. The messenger facility will facilitate communication between students and tutors - when students request a tutor, the tutor and student will be able to use this facility to arrange a convenient time, place and tuition fee for the tutor service. \\
3.2.3 Request appropriate tutors for students who send a request on the app for a tutor eligible to tutor a specific course (aid to pair up appropriate tutors and students).\\
3.2.4 In the light of security, the database shall be able store a corresponding password for each user of the application, which will allow for each users account to be protected, as each user's users email address and entered password will be compared to that of which was entered into the database at sign-up, hence the system restricting access to authorized users. \\
3.2.5 FindMeTutor Android application will be able to be utilised on any Android OS of (some version), which is able easily accessible,as many students can download this application for use on their smartphones and/or tablets which shall makes the application easily accessible.

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}{
Describes the user-level requirements that are not directly related to the functionality. \\
\\\textbf{3.3.1 Usability}\\ 
The application will be user friendly as it will be an Android application which is supported by multiple devices (android smartphones and android tablets). This will allow for the application to be easily accessible to students and tutors as majority of students have access to android devices. 
\\\textbf{3.3.2 Reliability}\\
The probability that the system will be able to process work correctly and completely without being aborted.\\
In the case of system failure, the damage that could be caused could be such where a user will not be able to use the app during system failure.
\\\textbf{3.3.3 Performance}\\
%The expected volume of data (??).
The response time between the UI and the server will be optimised. The expected volume of user activity will peak at the end of each academic term within the tertiary institute when examinations/tests will be approaching, while on a regular basis the application will be utilised when students who feel the need to get assistance when they encounter a topic they require assistance in. 
\\\textbf{3.3.4 Supportability}\\
The App will be facilitated over a spectrum of Android platform versions. The SDK supports 14-24. \\
\textbf{3.3.5 Implementation}\\
Our team has implemented the agile methodology in order to obtain our final goal of building the FindMeTutor application. For each sprint we will set targets of what we would like to achieve, with the objective of using these milestones to be building blocks towards our final goal. 
\\\textbf{3.3.6 Interface}\\
The UI will be made in Android studio. The set up will be simple and neat. The app will be used by students who will be using the app in order to search for a tutor which is suitable to tutor, hence, with this intention, to prevent furthering the overwhelmed feeling, the app will not be clutered and simple to use. The 'user-friendly' experience provided by the UI, will allow the user to interact with the app in a natural and intuitive way. \\
Each user's home page will be customized to display there upcoming tutorial sessions.\\
\textbf{3.3.7 Packaging}\\
Android studio for development\\
Adobe illustrator and photoshop for App graphics - FindMeTutor logo\\
%\textbf{3.3.8 Legal}\\

\subsection{System models}

\subsubsection{Scenario}
\begin{flushleft}

For instance, there is a student - Joe Soap - who is currently doing his 3rd year of study in computer science. Joe would like to generate some income from tutoring first and second year mathematics modules. We also know that the student, Mary Smith, is a first year astronomy student who is looking for a mathematics tutor. The FindMeTutor app will be ideal to resolve the problems faced in this particular scenario. Joe will register on the application as a tutor, on registering, he will select what he is capable and willing to tutor - first and second year mathematics. On the other hand, we will have Mary register as a student. Mary will then be able to search for the course she needs assistance in, for example – Calculus I. Mary will click the 'Request tutor' button and specify Calculus I as a subject as well as a date and time, this will send a request to all those who have registered to tutor Calculus I. Joe Soap will be part of the list of tutors approached. Joe accepts the request. Mary is notified of this and of any other Calculus I tutors who accept the request, Marry is able to select Joe Soap to confirm a tutorial session. Marry and Joe independently need to 'check-in' and 'checkout' before and after the tutorial respectively.

\subsubsection{Analysis object model}
%(Attached P17)
\subsubsection{Dynamic model}
%(Attached P18)
%A dynamic model represents the behaviour of an object over time. It is used where the object's behaviour is best described as a set of states that occur in a defined sequence. The components of the dynamic model are:\\
 %	States. The purchase order (PO) is modelled as passing through a set of states. The operations that can be performed on the PO are dependent on the state it is in. For example, information cannot be entered after it has reached the approved state.\\
	%State transitions. When purchase order data entry has been completed it transitions from the entering PO state to the pending approval state. State transitions are modelled as being instantaneous.\\
%	Events. Events trigger state transitions. For example, the order mailed event triggers a state transition from the approved to the placed state.\\
%	Actions. Actions occur on state transitions. For example, on a goods received event the action of notify purchaser is performed. Actions are modelled as instantaneous occurrences (contrast with activities).\\
%	Activities. An activity is performed while an object is in a specific state. For example, while in the entering PO state data is entered into the PO. Activities are modelled as occurring over a period of time (contrast with actions).\\
